```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
install.packages("glmnet")
library(glmnet)
```

you have to create two matrixes for glmnet
you do not have to add the columns of 1


gaussian - we assume the residuals are normally distributed
binomial - for logistic regression


plot(ridge) will print the outcome of the cross validation
